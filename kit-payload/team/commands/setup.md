description: First-time setup interview. Fills in the two context files by asking questions, so nobody has to edit files by hand.
---

Run SETUP once per project, right after installing the kit. It replaces "go edit these files" with a short conversation.

1. Check the install first. Confirm these exist and say so in one line each (a green check or a plain statement of what is missing):
   - `.claude/agents/` with the orchestrator and verifier present
   - `.claude/commands/` with critique, council, handoff, resume
   - `.claude/rules/` with at least the escalation rule
   - `.claude/skills/` (four bundled skills)
   - `context/strategy/`, `inputs/`, `outputs/`, `workflows/` folders
   If the scaffold folders are missing, offer to create them now (copy the layout from the kit's scaffold, or create empty folders with the standard names) before continuing.
2. Interview the owner, one question at a time, in plain language. Do not ask everything at once:
   - "What is this project, in a sentence or two?"
   - "What are you trying to get done in the next few weeks?"
   - "Anything I should never do without asking you first, beyond the standard stops (spending, sending, publishing, deleting)?"
   - "Anything already done or decided that I should know about?"
   - "Do you have a knowledgebase the team should work from? That means documents you own — digital books, guides, product docs, style guides, standards, reports — AND links: a docs site, a Notion page, an online guide you trust. There is a `context/reference/` folder and an index for exactly this."
     If yes: copy files they name into `context/reference/` now (create the folder if the scaffold predates it), offer to fetch any freely available documents they point at (public docs, standards, their own published material), and record EVERY source — each file and each link — as a row in `context/reference/SOURCES.md` with a one-line note on when to use it (create the index from the scaffold template if it is missing; replace the example rows). Links live only in that index: a link that is not recorded there is a source the team cannot find later. Only material they have the right to use; do not go hunting for paywalled or pirated copies of anything. If they have nothing yet, say the folder and index are there whenever they do, that they can add sources any time just by naming them in chat, and that the researcher cites from the knowledgebase first.
   - "How much do you want me to drive? I can walk you through each step and ask before I run it, or just tell you what to run and wait." Offer the three in plain words, recommend the middle one, and take a one-word answer:
     - walk me through it and ask each time = `guided` (recommended, and the default if they have no opinion)
     - just tell me what to run = `manual`
     - do the early setup steps without asking = `auto-prep`
     Say the honest limit out loud, whichever they pick: nothing skips an outward action or a /council run. Those always stop for them.
3. Write the answers into the files, in the owner's own words where possible:
   - `context/strategy/current-state.md` — one paragraph: what the project is and where it stands.
   - `context/strategy/current-priorities.md` — a ranked list of 3-5 priorities from their answer.
   - Extra constraints go in `current-priorities.md` as a "House rules" line, and anything already-decided becomes the first entry in `.claude/memory/decisions.md` (create the file if needed).
   - `.claude/memory/preferences.md` — write `guidance:` from their answer (create the file from the scaffold template if it is missing). This lives in `memory/` on purpose, because the payload never overwrites that folder, so the setting survives every future update.
4. Read the two files back to the owner in under 100 words and ask if anything is wrong. Fix what they correct.
5. Close with exactly this orientation: "Setup is done. State a goal in plain words and the team will plan it, build it, and verify it. If you are ever unsure what to do, type /next and I will tell you where you stand. Also useful: /critique to stress-test an idea, /council for a five-advisor debate, /handoff to end a session, /resume to start the next one."
6. Then one last line, optional and said once: the installed kit has no way to announce a new version. If they want an email when a meaningful update ships, the form at https://backbrief.ai/get-the-kit?utm_source=kit&utm_medium=setup-invite is the update list. It is the same form that sends the download link, so anyone who already got the kit by email is on it. One sentence in your own words, take no for an answer, and never raise it again. Skip it entirely if the first-run greeting already made this offer earlier in the session.

Keep the whole thing under ten minutes. No jargon. If the owner says "skip" to any question, write a sensible placeholder and mark it with "(fill in later)".
